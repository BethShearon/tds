# Tulsa Data Science: Python for Neural Networks (Fall 2018)

## About the Meetup
Our Monday night workshops (9/10 - 12/3) are geared towards *cultivating a proficiency in neural network development* (through Python), in the format of a course. 
### Workshop + Course format:
- Each workshop builds on the previous: starting from an intro to Python, we lead up to neural network development (and include a hand-written image recognition project!)
- **New Member? Join us!** All materials are self-contained, and can be followed along by new arrivals. (And if we fail in this goal, let us know!)
- **Pace too fast?** The course has clear checkpoints along the way, and restarts witheach semester. Feel free to continue your practice (*right where it gets uncomfortable*), and meet us again! All posted materials are intended to guide your practice, and can be used at your own pace.
